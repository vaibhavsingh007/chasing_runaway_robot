Advanced AI for Robotics - PROJECT. 

 ----------
## Background
 
 A robotics company named Trax has created a line of small self-driving robots 
 designed to autonomously traverse desert environments in search of undiscovered
 water deposits.

 A Traxbot looks like a small tank. Each one is about half a meter long and drives
 on two continuous metal tracks. In order to maneuver itself, a Traxbot can do one
 of two things: it can drive in a straight line or it can turn. So to make a 
 right turn, A Traxbot will drive forward, stop, turn x degrees, then continue
 driving straight.

 This series of questions involves the recovery of a rogue Traxbot. This bot has 
 gotten lost somewhere in the desert and is now stuck driving in an almost-circle: it has
 been repeatedly driving forward by some step size, stopping, turning a certain 
 amount, and repeating this process... Luckily, the Traxbot is still sending all
 of its sensor data back to headquarters.

 In this project, we will start with a simple version of this problem and 
 gradually add complexity. By the end, you will have a fully articulated
 plan for recovering the lost Traxbot.
